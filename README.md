### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate full-stack web developer with over 1.5 years of experience, specializing in **JavaScript** and **React**. My journey began as a frontend developer, but I’ve since expanded my skills into backend development with **C#** and **.NET Core 6**. Currently, I’m working at **EY**, contributing to a cutting-edge web platform for workforce upskilling and reskilling.

I enjoy **building reusable components**, optimizing UI performance, and ensuring smooth user experiences. I’ve worked across the full stack, delivering features end-to-end — from frontend development to API integration and database design. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and grow as a developer!
